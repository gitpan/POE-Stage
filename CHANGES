    sproingle and mst (irc.perl.org #moose) made the point that the
    developer version number makes this harder for average people to find
    and play with, which may be hindering the project's adoption. This
    revision removes the underscore and documents the project's
    not-ready-for-prime-time nature.

    Skip the callback leak warning if the leaked callback is stored in
    the symbol table. Symbol tables are destroyed after END, so it'll
    assume callbacks in the symbol table aren't leaks.

  MANIFEST M; examples/wide-finder.perl A

    On Chris Prather's prompting, implement a version of his wide-finder
    example. 

  2007-10-15 01:21:39 (r165) by rcaputo; examples/candygram.perl M

    Oops. Remove Chris Prather's original code.

  examples/candygram.perl A; MANIFEST M

    Add candygram.perl example.

  lib/POE/Callback.pm M; MANIFEST M

    Forgot to alias $self, $req and $rsp. Also forgot to add Philip
    Gwyn's tests to the MANIFEST.

  lib/POE/Callback.pm M; t/10_callback.t A

    Applied Philip Gwyn's patch (plus some tightening up) to generate
    optimal lexical magic for POE::Callback objects. Resolves rt.cpan.org
    #29975.

    Second revision.

  2007-07-10 09:20:41 (r160) by rcaputo; NOTES.CPS A

    Initial add of a rough outline for an article or talk explaining
    POE::Stage as a continuation-passing system.
