  lib/POE/Stage.pm M

    Remove moostage.perl from examples. It lives in the lab for now. Work
    around the Perl segfault plaguing 0.04. 

  2009-04-27 07:07:30 (r181) by rcaputo; lab/moosestage_actors.perl M

    Fix a typo.

  2008-12-20 07:18:43 (r180) by rcaputo; lab/moostage.perl A

    Borrow liberally from moosestage_actor.perl, but not quite assimilate
    the actors themselves. I'm not sure it's good to make actors 1:1 with
    these objects.
    
    Get my MooseX::AttributeHelpers on. They're kinda nifty. 

  2008-12-20 07:15:17 (r179) by rcaputo; lab/moosestage_actors.perl M

    Minor changes. Add a bit of vim configuration so I don't blow the
    author's style. Make actor IDs a bit more unique. 

  2008-12-20 05:30:40 (r178) by perigrin; lab/moosestage_actors.perl M

    add optimization for collecting messages

  2008-12-20 03:22:43 (r177) by perigrin; lab/moosestage_actors.perl M

    move actors up into the namespace

  2008-12-20 03:03:13 (r176) by rcaputo; examples/moostage.perl M

    Flesh out the dispatcher with some ideas that might find their way
    back into POE::Loop. 

  2008-12-20 02:56:44 (r175) by perigrin; lab/moosestage_actors.perl A

    refactor moosestage into an actor model

  2008-12-15 22:39:06 (r174) by rcaputo; examples/moostage.perl A

    Add for tracking. 

  2008-12-15 16:20:18 (r173) by rcaputo; Makefile.PL M

    Keep UTF8 out of the README, because that messes up the SYNOPSIS.

  examples/self-requesting-stage.perl M; lib/POE/Callback.pm M;
  examples/tut-010-app.perl A; lib/POE/Stage.pm M; lib/POE/Request.pm M

    Get self-requesting-stage.perl working again.
    
    Implement pass_to() but do not document it. The docs are a bit
    outdated anyway, and pass_to() may not be final.
    
    Create a basic tutorial around the "hello, world!" synopsis example.

    Many things were missing from the MANIFEST.
